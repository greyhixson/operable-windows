# Operable Windows Notifier
Completed project for my honors thesis at the University of Arkansas.
The project was created in coordination with the Office for Sustainability to create an application that allows for an admin to manage and register an organization and can setup spaces with various parameters. Users can then search for organizations and spaces and get notified whether their operable window should be opened or closed.
