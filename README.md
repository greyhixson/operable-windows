# Operable Windows Notifier
Completed project for my honors thesis at the University of Arkansas https://scholarworks.uark.edu/csceuht/100/.
The web application allows for an admin to create an organization and then add and update spaces for their organization. A user can then search for their organization and then for a specific space. The application will then display a visual card which conveys details surrounding the window for their space as set by the admin.
